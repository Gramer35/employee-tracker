# employee-tracker


## Description

The purpose of this program is to create a tracker for an employer so that they can keep track of their employees and their roles along with their salary. Additionally, when a new role, department, or employee is needed, the user can add each of those. When an employee role needs adjusting, that can be arranged as well. This allows for easy tracking of employees and their roles.  

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?
